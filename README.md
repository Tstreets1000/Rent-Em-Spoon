# Big Poppa Code React Starter Kit
This Starter Kit is being created for New Web Developers that want to get started with react

Most people use a CLI Tool like Vue-Cli or Create React App and no idea what these things are doing

The goal of this is for it to be a tool that let's you learn JS at a new level because you have access to
everything under the hood and no opinionated set up

I will base all my tutorials on this Starter Kit.

# Rent-Em-Spoons Cafe 
I created a simple version of a cafe for lovers of Soup and good times. The inspiration behind the design of the cafe comes from one of my favorite episodes of the Martin TV show(Season 3, Episode 22.) url(https://youtu.be/KQGLdr8DXtI)
